## Todo List Web Application

### Overview
This project is a simple web application where authenticated users can manage their todo lists. Users can log in using Google Single Sign-On (SSO) via Firebase Authentication. Once logged in, users can add, view, mark as completed/favorite, or remove todo tasks. The application also supports searching and filtering tasks by status. The frontend is built using React, and Firebase or LocalSorage is used to store and retrieve data.
